### Spotify API Credentials
1. Copy `lib/config/secrets.example.dart` to `lib/config/secrets.dart`
2. Replace the placeholder values in `secrets.dart` with your Spotify API credentials:
   ```dart
   class SpotifySecrets {
     static const String clientId = 'your_client_id_here';
     static const String clientSecret = 'your_client_secret_here';
   }
   ```
3. Never commit `secrets.dart` to version control
